## Benchmark for https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/best-free-proxy-list-web-scraping/"

This repository contains the script used for the blog post above. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3

```pip install requests```

```pip install beautifulsoup4````

A ScrapingBee API key, you can get one here for free with 1000 credits: https://www.scrapingbee.com/

You'll need a ScrapingBee API key because the proxy list websites are will block your IP after a few request, which is kind of ironic :)

Then you will find the instructions inside the script to perform the test against different website & proxy lists.
